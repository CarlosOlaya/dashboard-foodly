<!-- Splash overlay — solid background that blends with the PWA manifest splash.
     No logo, no spinner — just the same background color so the transition
     from the PWA splash to the login is seamless (2 states, not 3). -->

<!-- Router always exists so Angular can resolve routes behind the splash -->
